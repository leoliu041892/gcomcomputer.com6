                    &nbsp People say the average computer lifespan has shrunk to two years . You would likely replace yours that often if you could. As newer and more memory-intensive software comes out, and old junk files accumulate on your hard drive, your computer gets slower and slower, and working with it gets more and more frustrating. You are tempted to run to the electronics store every time you double-click your favorite application and have to wait 30 seconds for it to open, or you open a second program and it brings your system to a grinding halt. But who can afford to shell out for a new machine in a tough economy?<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp Fortunately, there are hardware upgrades that can extend the useful life of your current computer without completely draining your account or relegating yet another piece of machinery to a landfill

                    We repair nearly all computers and components including desktops, all-in-ones, notebooks, monitors, and main accessories. Whether you purchased it at FutureshopÂ® or somewhere else, we can fix it. We will run the device through our diagnostic routine and give you an estimate of the costs before beginning any work. Sometime the cost to repair exceeds the price to just purchase a new one and we'll make sure we tell you if that's the case.
